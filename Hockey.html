				<p id="intro_content">Field hockey is a game played with curved sticks and a ball. It is a team
				sport with 2 teams consisting of 11 members each. It is played in a rectangular field. It is played
				in two halves. Each half lasts for 35 minutes and the break in between usually runs for about five
				to ten minutes. Field hockey is believed to have dated from the earliest civilizations. the Arabs, 
				Greeks, Persians and Romans each had their own versions. Field hockey first began in English schools 
				in the late 19th century. Gradually, international competitions began in 1895. Field hockey is now the 
				national sport of India and is also an Olympics sport.<br><br>
                In Field hockey, players are only allowed to hit the ball with the flat side of their stick except for
				the goalkeepers who are allowed to use their body or feet to prevent the opponent from scoring. If you
				use the other side of the stick, it is called a backstick shot and will result in a penalty. It is not
				allowed to swing your stick higher than your shoulders. This is called a dangerous shot. In Field Hockey,
				there are three penalty cards. The green card is a warning to players and a reminder not to break the rules.
				The yellow card temporarily suspends the player for a minimum of 5 minutes. The red card is used to 
				permanently suspend the player from the match, forcing the team to play with fewer members. All Field Hockey
				competitions are governed by the International Hockey Federation which is also called the FIH.</p>
