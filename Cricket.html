				<p id="intro_content">The game of cricket started in England first, but now it is played all 
				over the globe and is very popular. Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two 
				teams with 11 players in each of them. The field is oval in shape with a rectangular 22-yard-long
				pitch in the center. In the game process, one team bats and tries to score runs, the more, 
				the better, while the second team fields and bowls, and attempts to dismiss the batsmen and 
				limit runs received by the first team. Teams switch between batting and fielding at the end of 
				innings.<br><br>
                The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members,
				twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple
				formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and,
				historically, single wicket cricket.</p>
