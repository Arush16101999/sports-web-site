				<p id="intro_content">Badminton is a racket-based sport played by serving a shuttlecock over 
				a net. Though it can be played with a partner, badminton is mostly considered an individual 
				sport. It is an indoor sport and typically requires a badminton court. The game first originated
				from the Great Britain and gradually became one of the most popular sports in the world. It is 
				currently the national sport of both Indonesia and Singapore and currently is also an Olympics 
				game. <br><br>
                In badminton, 21 points must be scored to win. However, there should be a gap of two points 
				between the players. A coin toss determines which player gets to serve on which side of the 
				court. When one of the players scores 11 marks, the sides are switched. The shuttlecock must 
				definitely be served to the opposite side. If the shuttlecock gets stopped by the net, falls on 
				your side of the court or is served out of the court the opposing player will receive a point. 
				There are many methods of serving such as strokes.  It is a good fitness and personality builder
				and is played by both men and women.  All badminton tournaments are governed under the Badminton
				World Federation which is also called BWF.</p>
